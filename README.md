<!-- Description of the app, including:
Purpose -->
The purpose of the program is to simulate a battle between pokemon until one loses by reaching zero health after loops of attacks from victorious opponent. 
<!-- Functionality -->

User stories:

As a user, I am able to choose a pokemon and take part in battles with other pokemon.
stretch: As a user, I am able to save my progress and have my pokemon gain experience from battles

Its function is to have objects with values assigned to them and those values decreasing through each loop by the other object till eventually one object meets the conditions.

Design & Planning Process: 
=======

To begin writing the code for our app, we sketched out some quick pseudocode. We knew we would need at least one class and two loops. One loop to begin the game itself, and one loop to begin the fight. 

Create 'Pokemon' class {

    stretch - method: level_up
}
